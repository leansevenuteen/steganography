  <p>Audio Video Steganography integrated Machine Learning</p>
</h1>
This project combines the use of classical steganography techniques for concealing data with machine learning (ML) models to detect hidden information within audio and video files. The implemented steganography techniques include Least Significant Bit, Phase Coding, and Spread Spectrum, and the project allows for embedding various data types, including text, images, and audio.


However, despite being intricately concealed, numerous studies have shown that machine learning models can easily detect data hidden using steganography techniques. Therefore, this project presents a method by which an ML model identifies concealed information in audio and video.
